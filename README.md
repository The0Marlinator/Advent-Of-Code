### My solutions to the 2023 Adevnt of code
## BASED ON:
# AoC-Java-Foundation
A Java foundation for solving Advent of Code and a complimentary solution to the first day (2021 though!).

# To solve daily challenges:
- Add day input text-file in resources folder, e.g. ./resources/day01/input.txt
- Use AocUtil to read the file; if you need more utility-functions you will have to write them you self.
- Use Day01.java as a template for each day, e.g. by using naming DayXX.java.
- Add the DayXX to AdventOfCode2022Solutions and run the main-method.
